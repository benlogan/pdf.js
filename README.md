# PDF.js

PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

Originally forked from the Mozilla project;
https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js

At this point the only significant change is that the viewer toolbars are hidden by default.

The original test PDF has been replaced and an index file has been added to reference a list of test PDF's that can be found in the web/documents directory.
